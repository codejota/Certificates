This repository contains all of my course and training certificates. Throughout my career, I have sought to expand my skills in various areas, including **software development**, **infrastructure**, **data analysis tools**, and more. Here you will find all the certifications I have acquired, organized by year and category. It might not be the best way to organize, but it is the one I found to make it easier to search and view the certificates. You can check more in my [Curriculum Vitae](https://www.cv.jotacode.dev).
